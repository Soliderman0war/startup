# Notes for Web Development
## Github learning
I was able to understand a bit more about merging and the conflict that happens.
Now I gotta learn how to link this for readme

## HTML
Learned quite a bit on the different uses that html provides and finished assignments accordingly
For Example
 - <a> hyperlink
 - use embed code for videos like youtube

## HTTPS / CADDY
Understood how to get a secure connection and lease a domain off of aws (view hosted zones allows the create records button)

## CSS
You can call different styles like background, padding, margin, borders and even animations can be added
