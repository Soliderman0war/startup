## Github learning
I was able to understand a bit more about merging and the conflict that happens.
Now I gotta learn how to link this for readme

## Elevator Pitch
Many people in their lives want to change or improve. However, they don't know how to start or sometimes even what to start on. I am proposing to create a website that selects an acitvity to do in 15 minutes to improve slightly each day. People can sign in and ultize it as they keep track on what they improved on, as well as select an activity again to improve further. IF they are unsure what to do then they can use the random option to get one selected for them.

## Website
### Key features
* A login feature
  Randomize selection button
  selection drop down

  databank of activities to pull from
  Completed acivities if logged in
